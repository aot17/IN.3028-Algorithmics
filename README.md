# Algorithmic Design Principles and Classic Problems

This course covers the foundational principles of algorithmic design, classic algorithmic problems, and key algorithms for solving these problems. Throughout the semester, we explored various algorithmic design principles, studied classical problems in computer science, and introduced elegant data structures and algorithms for solving these problems. Practical applications were used to illustrate these concepts.

## Course Overview

### Algorithmic Design Principles

General approaches for developing algorithms covered in this course include:

- **Recursive and Inductive Methods**: Solving problems by breaking them down into simpler versions of the same problem.
- **Divide-and-Conquer**: Dividing a problem into subproblems, solving them independently, and combining their solutions.
- **Backtracking**: Searching for solutions by exploring and backtracking as necessary.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Breaking down problems into simpler subproblems and storing results to avoid redundant calculations.

### Classic Algorithmic Problems and Solutions

We delved into classical problems of computer science, discussing algorithms and data structures developed for these challenges:

- **Sort**: Merge sort and quicksort.
- **Search**: Symbol tables, binary search trees, balanced search trees, and hash tables.
- **Graphs**: Spanning trees, shortest paths, and maximum flows.
- **Strings**: String search algorithms, tries, regular expressions, and data compression techniques.

### Practical Applications

Real-world examples were used to demonstrate the application of algorithmic principles in solving practical problems.

## Course Structure

The course included lectures, hands-on exercises, and project work, allowing students to implement and understand the algorithms and data structures discussed.

### Prerequisites

Students were expected to have a basic understanding of computer science and programming, including familiarity with data structures and experience with a programming language.
